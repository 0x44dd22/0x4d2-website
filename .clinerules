## Technical Context

0x4d2 is a bare bones website built in pure html and css and deployed to github pages. The development environment is macOS using the VS Code IDE. 

JS could be used if needed for responsiveness, but no JS would be preferred.

The background color should be rgb(64,81,78). 

The logo is in `static/logo.svg` and this should be used for the favicon and any graphical needs in the main html page. There is a fall back png version of the logo if needed.

The file `static/robots.txt` should be used to prevent scraping from search engines as we do not want this site to necessarily have much attention.

The site will be hosted on github pages at 0x4d2.com after I setp DNS on our webhosting provider Namecheap.

Sample pages that should be used for inspiration are found in the `inspiration` folder.

You can use the files in `static` and move the to wherever you want.

The site will list our current products. We don't have any yet, so just put two placholders for now: abdc.com and xyz.com

There needs to be 3 links to 3 pages: Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and Refund and dispute policy. Put some generic text in those files. The policy files need to cover all products listed above. The products are all Saas websites that people sign up for with a monthly subscript and pay via Stripe.

Use the image: `undraw_page-not-found_6wni.svg` for any 404 page not founds.


## Website Design Elements

* The contact info should appear somewhere and link to email address: hello@0x4d2.com as well as our phone number at +1 (833) 856-2733.
* color pallet is: #40514e, #e4f9f5, #576d69, #293533, #ffffff, #baf0e6
* The font to use is at `static/lineto-circular-bookitalic.woff2`(It is free for commercial and personal use: https://www.freefonts.io/circular-book-font/)
* Should be responisive, looking good on desktop and smart phones
* Explore ideas with a gradient background, maybe with some abstract overlayed elements towards the bottom of the page
* I want a header app bar on the site. Upper left should be our logo around 80x80 px in size followed by the company name: 0x4d2, both clickable and go to the root of the site 
* Maybe the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and Refund and dispute policy should be in a footer, stickied to the bottom of the window. 
* The company name, the company'y project/product list should be in the middle as we as a buoon to contact us. Use one of the undraw images in the center of the page as well. 
* On the contact page, use the image: `dee_bugger_avatar.png`. And make our email address and phone number visible.
* Make placeholder pages for the two projects: abdc.com and xyz.com
